* `-r, --recursive`:  Also act on all descending datasets
* `-n, --dry-run`

#### create

Creates a snapshot with a random 64 bit hex name.

#### prune

Policy-based purging of zfs snapshots. Uses "restic forget" syntax.

Also see "https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/internal/restic/snapshot_policy.go" and "https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/060_forget.html"

#### push/pull

Sends snapshots from source dataset to destination dataset. The newest common snapshot is always held on both sides so that it cannot be pruned/destroyed.
